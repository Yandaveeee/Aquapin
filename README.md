# Aquapin

Aquapin is an aquaculture management system built as a monorepo. It combines an offline-first mobile app for field operations, a web-based admin console, shared TypeScript models, and Supabase-backed authentication, data storage, and serverless functions.

## System Overview

The system is split into four main parts:

- `apps/mobile`: Expo React Native app for field staff
- `apps/web`: Next.js admin console
- `packages/shared`: shared TypeScript types used across apps
- `supabase`: SQL schema, RLS policies, templates, and edge functions

Core capabilities already represented in the codebase include:

- pond registration and geospatial location capture
- stocking, mortality, and harvest records
- pond history tracking
- offline data entry with local persistence
- sync queue monitoring and manual sync
- field staff authentication and role-based access control
- admin dashboard and typed settings management

## Implementation Milestones

### Step 1: Core Supabase schema and auth foundation

- creates `public_profiles`, `ponds`, `mortality_logs`, and `harvests`
- enables PostGIS for geospatial pond data
- sets up auth-triggered profile creation on signup
- adds initial RLS helpers and baseline access policies

### Step 2: Pond write-access fix

- fixes blocked pond inserts caused by RLS
- explicitly allows pond creation for authenticated field staff
- adds optional admin update/delete access for pond records

### Step 3: Advanced sync and farm-history schema upgrade

- adds pond metadata fields such as `boundary`, `is_active`, `current_species`, and `current_stock_count`
- adds enhanced harvest fields for species, partial harvests, and fish count
- creates `stocking_logs` and `pond_history`
- adds indexes, RLS policies, and realtime publication support for the new tables

### Step 4: Admin settings and audit tables

- creates `admin_settings` for structured configuration storage
- creates `admin_settings_audit` for change tracking
- adds admin-only policies for reading and writing settings

### Step 5: Admin RPC and audit foundation

- adds database RPC support for audited admin setting updates
- introduces admin access-audit infrastructure from the earlier backend rollout
- provides the privileged database layer used by admin configuration workflows

### Step 6: Profile repair and no-approval access flow

- repairs missing `public_profiles` rows for existing auth users
- ensures new signups automatically receive a usable field staff profile
- upgrades legacy pending staff records to approved
- removes approval dependency from the staff-access helper used by RLS
- allows safe self-repair profile inserts for authenticated users when triggers are incomplete

## Main Modules

### Mobile app

The mobile application is designed for field use and local-first workflows. Current modules in the codebase include:

- authentication and protected navigation
- pond mapping and pond creation
- stocking, mortality, and harvest logging
- pond history and record review
- sync status and queue visibility
- profile, notification, security, and export settings
- AI assistant/reporting screens

Implementation notes:

- built with Expo and React Native
- uses WatermelonDB when available, with an AsyncStorage-backed mock fallback for Expo Go compatibility
- uses Supabase for auth and remote persistence

### Web admin console

The web app is a Next.js admin interface focused on system oversight and governance. Current pages and services include:

- landing page
- login and reset password flow
- admin dashboard with operational overview
- admin settings editor with audit trail

### Shared package

`packages/shared` exports database and admin types so the web app can work against a typed Supabase schema.

### Supabase backend

The `supabase/` directory contains:

- SQL schema setup scripts
- RLS and access-control updates
- admin settings RPC support
- email templates
- edge functions for AI reports and sync/data verification

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ recommended
- npm with workspace support
- Expo CLI tooling through project scripts
- a Supabase project
- Android Studio and/or Xcode if you want native mobile builds

## Environment Variables

### Web app

Create `apps/web/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

The repository already includes `apps/web/.env.example` as a starting point.

### Mobile app

Create `apps/mobile/.env`:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPS_API_KEY=your-maps-api-key
EXPO_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH_EMAIL_REDIRECT_URL=aquapin://auth/callback
```

Required mobile variables:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Optional mobile variables:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPS_API_KEY`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH_EMAIL_REDIRECT_URL`

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Supabase

Set up your Supabase project and apply the SQL scripts in `supabase/`.

Recommended order:

1. `supabase/step1_schema.sql`
2. `supabase/step2_rls_policies_fix.sql`
3. `supabase/step3_schema_upgrade.sql`
4. `supabase/step4_settings_schema.sql`
5. `supabase/step5_admin_access_schema.sql`
6. `supabase/step6_profile_repair.sql`
7. `supabase/step7_account_scoped_rls.sql`

If you are using the consolidated setup script, review `supabase/full_setup_safe.sql`.

### 3. Run the web app

From the repo root:

```bash
npm run web:dev
```

Other web commands:

```bash
npm run web:build
npm run web:typecheck
npm run web:lint
```

### 4. Run the mobile app

From `apps/mobile`:

```bash
npm start
```

Useful mobile commands:

```bash
npm run android
npm run ios
npm run start:dev-client
npm run prebuild
npm run prebuild:clean
```

## EAS Build Commands

From the repo root:

```bash
npm run mobile:eas:build:android:preview
npm run mobile:eas:build:android:production
npm run mobile:eas:build:ios:production
```

## Supabase Edge Functions

Available functions:

- `supabase/functions/ai-reports`
- `supabase/functions/verify-data`

Deploy with:

```bash
supabase functions deploy ai-reports
supabase functions deploy verify-data
```

## Authentication and Access Model

The system uses Supabase Auth with profile and role data stored in `public_profiles`.

Roles in the current schema:

- `admin`
- `field_staff`

Admin-related backend support includes:

- typed admin settings storage
- admin settings audit history

## Offline-First Data Flow

The mobile app is structured around offline-first operation:

1. field staff records data locally
2. changes are queued when offline
3. the sync module retries when connectivity returns
4. Supabase becomes the shared source for cross-device/admin visibility

Tracked operational entities in the current codebase include:

- ponds
- stocking logs
- mortality logs
- harvests
- pond history

## Notes

- `apps/mobile/README.md` contains older mobile-specific implementation notes.
- Some repository areas still contain legacy naming or prototype logic, especially in marketing copy and edge-function internals. Treat this root README as the system-level guide to the current intended structure.
